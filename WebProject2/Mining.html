            Mining is one of the most important activities in the game. It's in the name of the game after all.<br/>
            There are 8 different ores in Minecraft, all with their own unique properties and uses.<br/>
            Here is a list of every ore in the game.
            <ul>
                <li>Coal</li>
                <li>Copper</li>
                <li>Iron</li>
                <li>Lapis Lazuli</li>
                <li>Redstone</li>
                <li>Gold</li>
                <li>Diamond</li>
                <li>Quartz (Nether only)</li>
            </ul>

            Each ore has its own unique use and function. Here is a quick summary of their uses.<br/><br/>
            Coal is primarily used for fuel and torches, with a few other side uses.<br/><br/>
            Copper is used for lightning rods and spyglasses. (Copper is a new addition, so it has very little use.)<br/><br/>
            Iron is used for a wide variety of tools, armor and equipment/blocks. Iron is one of the most useful resources in the game.<br/><br/>
            Lapis Lazuli is used in enchantment tables to enchant tools and weapons. It can also be used as blue dye. <br/><br/>
            Redstone has many functions. It's used in circuits, contraptions and other mechanisms. It is a very complex part of the game.<br/><br/>
            Gold can be used for tools, weapons and armor, however it's not a good idea to use them in that manner. Gold equipment has very low durability. <br/><br/>
            Gold is most useful in the Nether to protect yourself from piglins. Gold is also used in some item crafting recipes.<br/><br/>
            Diamond can be used to create tools, weapons and armor. Diamond tools are extremely useful and durable.
